# Parallelism

- Executing two or more programs simultaneously.

- Make progress on two or more things simultaneously.

- To achieve parallelism: run code on multiprocessors.

**Parallelism Vs Concurrency**

![Concurrency Vs Parallelism](../../images/Concurrency%20And%20Parallelism.jpg)

First diagram shows the analogyof the concurrency where we have two queue waiting to be served by the vending machine. Note that we have a single vending machine which is served to by two different queues. 

While in the second diagram, it depicts the parallelism where we have two vending machine serving the separate queues individually.

> Parallelism Application involves: performing heavy number crunching, or performing computationally expensive tasks.


## CPU Bound Bottleneck

- Program executing rate is bounded by the speed of CPU or number of cores. For example, Computation speed might get affected.

- If rate of processing data outweights the rate of requesting data, there is a CPU bound bottleneck.
