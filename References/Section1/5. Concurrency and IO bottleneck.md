# Concurrency And Parallelism


## 1. Concurrency is:
- Performing multiple tasks at a time
- Not compulsorily parallel
- Improves application performance and speed

From [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1050257)

```md
Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core machine.

Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.

## 2. Properties of Concurrent Systems:

**i. Multiple Actors:**

- Represents different processes and threads make progress on their own tasks.

- Multi threads runing simultaneously.

**ii. Shared Resources:**

- Represents the memory, disk, and other resources.

- Utilized by actors to perform tasks.

**iii. Rules:**

- Represents a set of rules followed by concurrent systems.

- If ignored, programs would tear themselves apart.

- Example could be locks, which defines a rules to access resources, ...


## 3. IO Bottlenecks:

Bottlenecks where a program spends more time waiting on various inputs and outputs than it does on processing the information.
