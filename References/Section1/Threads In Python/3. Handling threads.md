# Handling and Managing Multiple Threads In Python

**Scope:**
- Creating and managing multilpe threads.


## List of Active Threads:

``threading.enumerate()`` returns a list of all alive threads.


```py
import threading
import random

def executeThread(i):
    print(f"Thread {i} started.")
    sleep = random.randint(1, 10)
    print(f"Thread {i} finished execution.")

for i in range(10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=executeThread, args=(i, ))
    thread.start()

    # returns a list of alive threads
    print("Active Therads:", threading.enumerate())
```

```sh
Output

Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
Active Therads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 137275576877184)>]
```


## Getting Current Thread:

- Use ``threading.current_thread()`` from threading module to get current thread object.

```py
import threading


def threadTarget():
    print(f"Current thread: {threading.current_thread()}")

threads = []

for i in range(10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=threadTarget)
    thread.start()
    threads.append(thread)

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

```

```sh
Output:

Current thread: <Thread(Thread-1 (threadTarget), started 138639419901632)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-2 (threadTarget), started 138639409415872)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-3 (threadTarget), started 138639419901632)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-5 (threadTarget), started 138639327626944)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-4 (threadTarget), started 138639409415872)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-8 (threadTarget), started 138639296169664)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-10 (threadTarget), started 138639275198144)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-9 (threadTarget), started 138639285683904)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-6 (threadTarget), started 138639317141184)>
Current thread: <Thread(Thread-7 (threadTarget), started 138639306655424)>
```


## Main Thread:

Each Python process is created with one thread called the main thread. This thread has the distinct name 'MainThread', although thread names can be changed. The main thread can be thought of as the default thread within a Python process.

```python
import threading
import time

def threadTarget():
    print("Child thread starting\n")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Currrent Thread: {threading.current_thread()} \n")
    print(f"Main Thread: {threading.main_thread()}\n")
    print("Child thread ended.")

thread = threading.Thread(target=threadTarget)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

> Note that: Each program always has a main thread, so if you were to create 4 of your own threads, application will have 5 threads including a main thread.

```sh
Output:

Child thread starting

Currrent Thread: <Thread(Thread-1 (threadTarget), started 127116316247744)> 

Main Thread: <_MainThread(MainThread, started 127116328865920)>

Child thread ended.
```

## Enumerating Active Threads

- To perform task: Query the status of all active threads.

- Keeping track of which threads are at play.

- ``threading.enumerate()`` can be used to list out all the thread object that are currently active, here active doesnt mean currently runing.

```python
import threading
import time
import random

def threadTarget(i):
    print(f"Thread {i} started..")
    time.sleep(random.randint(1, 3))
    print(f"Thread {i} finished.")

def main():
    for i in range(4):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=threadTarget, args=(i, ))
        thread.start()
    
    # this doesnt mean all runing, but actively in progress or paused
    print("\nList of all active threads:")
    for t in threading.enumerate():
        print(t)
    print("\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```sh
# Output:

Thread 0 started..
Thread 1 started..
Thread 2 started..
Thread 3 started..

List of all active threads:
<_MainThread(MainThread, started 140277581705344)>
<Thread(Thread-1 (threadTarget), started 140277568243392)>
<Thread(Thread-2 (threadTarget), started 140277557757632)>
<Thread(Thread-3 (threadTarget), started 140277547271872)>
<Thread(Thread-4 (threadTarget), started 140277536786112)>


Thread 0 finished.
Thread 2 finished.
Thread 3 finished.
Thread 1 finished.
```

## How to identify thread: Using Thread Name

- Sometimes during a runtime, we might deligate different taks to different thread, we might need to examine the threads, so we need to give thread a name to identify and distinguish them from each other.

- We can give custom name to thread **by passing name to constructor params.**

- Thread name can be retrived during runtime with: ``threading.current_thread.name``


```python
import threading
import time

def threadTarget():
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name} ended")

for i in range(4):
    threadName = "Thread-" + str(i)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=threadTarget, name=threadName)
    thread.start()
```

## Stopping Process:

Always implement mechanism for graceful shutdown as opposed to killing it, so that the resources can be gracefully released.
Though threads doesnt natively implement the killing meahcnism, however 

More on killing a thread and process [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/323972/is-there-any-way-to-kill-a-thread)

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def processWorker():
    t1 = time.time()
    print(f"Process started at: {t1}")
    time.sleep(20)

process = multiprocessing.Process(target=processWorker)
print(f"Process: {process}")

# process started
process.start()

print("Terminating process..")
process.terminate()

process.join()

print(f"Process terminated: {process}")

```
