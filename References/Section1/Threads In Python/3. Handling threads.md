# Handling and Managing Multiple Threads In Python

**Scope:**
- Creating and managing multilpe threads.


**Creating a breamin thread:**

```py
import threading
import random

def executeThread(i):
    print(f"Thread {i} started.")
    sleep = random.randint(1, 10)
    print(f"Thread {i} finished execution.")

for i in range(10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=executeThread, args=(i, ))
    thread.start()

    # returns a list of alive threads
    print("Active Therads:", threading.enumerate())
```

**Few Caveats to Follow With Threads:**
- Threads does not improve the application performance if 100s of threads are thrown at a same problem.
- Instead some times, process would come handy in such cases.
