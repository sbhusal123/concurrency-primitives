# Starting A Therad


## Class Based Implementation

```py
from threading import Thread

class WorkerThread(Thread):

    def __init__(self):
        print("Created worker thread object")
        Thread.__init__(self)
    
    def run(self):
        print("Thread is now running.")
    
thread = WorkerThread()

thread.start()
print("Started worked thread")

thread.join()
print("Worker thread finished execution")
```

Above code shows the implementation of how threads can be implemented as a class, Note that:

- Class should inherit from ``threading.Thread`` module.

- Constructor should initialize the thread as ``Thread.__init__``

- Target code to be ran by thread should be handled in run method.


## Forking

FOrking is a way to create a second exact replica of a process. When we fork a process, it makes a clone of a given process and runs it as a child process of the process from which it was forked.

Cloned process gets:
- Address space
- Eact copy of parent's data
- Recieves a unique process Identifier (PID)
- Independent of parent process

Note that we can get the process identifier with: ``os.getpid()``

```python
import os

"""
Note that this implementation is only available in unix based os.
"""

def child():
    print(f"We are in the child process with PID={os.getpid()}")

def parent():
    newRef = os.fork()

    # in case if its child process
    if newRef == 0:
        child()
    else:
        child()

parent()

```

```sh
We are in the child process with PID=43281
We are in the child process with PID=43282
```

Note that the two calls have different process id. More about forking [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-os-fork-method/)


## Daemonizing a Thread 

Basically daemon threads are a background threads, that runs untill the program ends. Usage includes a background jobs.

Daemon threads are essentially threads that have no defined endpoint, they will continue to run forever untill program quits.

**Example Of Daemon Thread Usage:**

![Deamon Threads](../../../images/Deamon%20Threads%20Example.png)

We could migrate the job of sending hearbeat signal to deamon thread.  Deamon thread can be started when the application starts, and the deamon thread can continously send the heartbeat signal without intervening the main thread or the process. This deamon thread will get automatically killed when the program quits. 

Basically in this scenario, daemon thread is acting as a heartbit signal sender.

```python
import threading
import time

def standardTime():
    print("Starting standard thread")
    time.sleep(10)
    print("Ending standard thread")

def heartBeatHandler():
    while True:
        print("Sending out heartbeat signal")
        time.sleep(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    standardThread = threading.Thread(target=standardTime)

    deamonThread = threading.Thread(target=heartBeatHandler, daemon=True)
    deamonThread.start()

    standardThread.start()

```

In the above code, we have two thread, one is a standard thread that is responsible for handling the usual job while daemon thread is responsible for sending the heartbeat signal. It periodically (in 2 seconds interval) sends the heartbeat signal.

```sh
# output
Sending out heartbeat signal
Starting standard thread
Sending out heartbeat signal
Sending out heartbeat signal
Sending out heartbeat signal
Sending out heartbeat signal
Ending standard thread
```
