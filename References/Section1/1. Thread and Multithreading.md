# Thread and Multithreading

## Thread

- An ordered stream of instructions that can be schedulded to run as such by operating system.

![Threads](../images/thread_processes.jpg)

- Lives within processes.

- Consists of:
    - A program counter
    - A stack
    - A set of registers and an identifier

- Smallest unit of execution

## Multiple Threads

- Interacts with shared resources

- Communicate with each others

- Share memory

- Read and write to different memory address

> Multiple different threads can reside in different cpus. 

## Multithreading

- Ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.

## Types of Threads

- **User Level Threads:** Used to create, run and kill for all tasks. Example: Python works at user level threads

- **Kernel Level Threads:** Very low-level threads acting on behalf of operating system.

## Advantages:

- Speed up blocking I/O bounded programs

- Lightweight (memory)

- Share resources

## Limitations:

- Global Interpreter Lock in case of some of the programming languages like python.

- Subject to race conditions.
